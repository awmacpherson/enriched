Repo to track current research in enriched higher category theory

I created this repo so that I have somewhere to point people when they ask "what's up with enriched higher category theory? I mean what's up with it?" I make no claim to be authoritative: this is just one person's perspective (until someone else contributes).

GitHub's MarkDown renderer doesn't render TeX, so I've run the .md files through pandoc to generate pdfs. Since the point is for them to be readable on GitHub, these pdfs are tracked and uploaded here (even though they are generated).
