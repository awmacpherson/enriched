Repo to track current research in enriched higher category theory

I created this repo so that I have somewhere to point people when they ask "what's up with enriched higher category theory? I mean what's up with it?" I make no claim to be authoritative: this is just one person's perspective (until someone else contributes).

If reading on GitHub, try the .ipynb (Jupyter notebook) files, as GitHub's MarkDown renderer doesn't render TeX.
