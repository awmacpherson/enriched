# Papers on enriched $\infty$-category theory

I created this repo so that I have somewhere to point people when they ask "what's up with enriched higher category theory? I mean what's up with it?" I make no claim to be authoritative: this is just one person's perspective (until someone else contributes).

## Papers of the now

Five hand-picked papers that represent what I know about the subject right now. I've probably missed some important ones &mdash; let me know or come and edit the list yourself!

- [1312.3178](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3178) &mdash; *Enriched ∞-categories via non-symmetric ∞-operads*, David Gepner and Rune Haugseng, 2013 (v1); 2015 (Adv. Math.); 2019 (v4).

  The major (in 2021) definition of enriched $\infty$-categories in use. Establishes properties of the category of presentable $\mathcal{V}$-categories (such as presentability when $\mathcal{V}$ is presentable). First construction of *adjoint enrichments* using a generators-and-relations model.

- [1805.07635](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07635) &mdash; *Yoneda lemma for enriched infinity categories*, V. Hinich, 2019 (v1); 2020 (Adv. Math.); 2021 (v8).

  Another attack on enriched $\mathcal{V}$-categories that focuses on the corepresenting planar operad (as opposed to the *generalised* planar operad prioritised by Gepner-Haugseng). Makes the adjoint enrichment a central theme and uses it to define enriched presheaves as a left $\mathcal{V}$-module and prove a Yoneda lemma.

- [2009.02428](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02428) &mdash; *An equivalence between enriched ∞-categories and ∞-categories with weak action*, Hadrian Heine, 2020.

  Upgrades either Hinich's or Gepner-Haugseng's construction of adjoint enrichments to an equivalence between the categories of enriched $\mathcal{V}$-categories and left $\mathcal{V}$-modules (I haven't checked which). This should make the theory of adjoint enrichments really usable, since in practice this seems to be the main way of defining $\mathcal{V}$-enrichments.

- [1902.08881](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08881) &mdash; *The operad corepresenting enrichment,* A. W. Macpherson, 2019 (v1); 2021 (HHA). 

  Equivalence of Hinich's planar operad $\mathtt{Ass}_X$ and Gepner-Haugseng's simplicial multicategory $\mathcal{O}_X$ for $X$ an $\infty$-groupoid, and hence equivalence of the corresponding $\infty$-categories of enriched $\infty$-categories. This does *not* address the important question of comparing their constructions of adjoint enrichments &mdash; still open as far as I know!

- [2008.11323](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11323) &mdash; *Enriched infinity categories I: enriched presheaves*, John D. Berman, 2020.

  Establishes fundamental properties of enriched presheaves over a presentable $\mathcal{V}$ as a $\mathcal{V}$-module: that they form a presentable $\mathcal{V}$-module generated as such by representables, that limits and colimits are pointwise, the tensor identities 
  $$
  \mathrm{PSh}^\mathcal{V}(C,M) \cong \mathrm{PSh}^\mathcal{V}(C,\mathcal{V})\otimes_\mathcal{V}M
  $$
  and that $\mathrm{PSh}^\mathcal{V}(C)$ is dual to $\mathrm{PSh}^\mathcal{V}(C^\mathrm{op})$ (all in the symmetric monoidal category of presentable $\mathcal{V}$-modules).

## Other papers that might be important

Leaving room here for other papers that don't fit into the above list (which will be kept to 7 items at most).
