    "# Papers on enriched $\\infty$-category theory\n",

    "\n",
    "  The major (in 2021) definition of enriched $\\infty$-categories in use. Establishes properties of the category of presentable $\\mathcal{V}$-categories (such as presentability when $\\mathcal{V}$ is presentable). First construction of *adjoint enrichments* using a generators-and-relations model.\n",

    "\n",
    "  Another attack on enriched $\\mathcal{V}$-categories that focuses on the corepresenting planar operad (as opposed to the *generalised* planar operad prioritised by Gepner-Haugseng). Makes the adjoint enrichment a central theme and uses it to define enriched presheaves as a left $\\mathcal{V}$-module and prove a Yoneda lemma.\n",

    "  Upgrades either Hinich's or Gepner-Haugseng's construction of adjoint enrichments to an equivalence between the categories of enriched $\\mathcal{V}$-categories and left $\\mathcal{V}$-modules (I haven't checked which). This should make the theory of adjoint enrichments really usable, since in practice this seems to be the main way of defining $\\mathcal{V}$-enrichments.\n",
